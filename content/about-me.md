## Who 

Hi, I'm Soumya (_sew-me-a_), an engineering and data leader.

![alt text](/images/soumya_mug.jpg)

## What

I work at the intersection of business, software engineering, and data.

For details, see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumyadsanyal) and [GitHub](https://github.com/soumyadsanyal).

<!-- ## Where -->

<!-- I live with my wife in Western Massachussetts. She is an orthopedic oncology surgeon.  -->

<!-- I work remotely, because it drives better business results.  -->

<!-- Online, I can be found on this page, and also often on [RLS](https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/). -->

<!-- Outside of work, I spend a good deal of time in the gym, training (_and being humbled by_) Olympic lifts. -->

## How

As a technology and data leader, I focus on creating value by root causing business problems, and efficiently solving them. I do so by aligning and integrating (a) problems, (b) people, (c) process, and (d) systems.
